# Very Basic GNN walk through

Based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8owQBFAHw7E) which walks through what a graph neural network is and some high level applications.

Just following along with the video and potentially adding additional visualizations:
- Loading Data
- Adding loss and evaluate functions to work with masks
- Define graph convolution layer
- Define fit function
- Fit basic model
- Replace adacency matrix with I to validate that graph repesentation is useful
- Mean Pool adjaceny matrix (deal with potential exploding signal)
- Compare mean pooling with Kipf normalization 
- Visalizations to compare various approaches
